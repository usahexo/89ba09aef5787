#  Casino Royale bring Faulkner to life in new show!

Fans of the great American novelist William Faulkner were in for a treat this week as the Casino Royale brought his novel "The Sound and the Fury" to life on stage.

The show, which is set in the Deep South during the 1930s, tells the story of the Compson family and their disintegrating dynasty. It was praised by critics as a "stunning and powerful production", with some describing it as "the most important theatrical event of the year".

Given Faulkner's well-known reputation for being difficult to adapt to the stage, it was a real coup for Casino Royale to secure the rights to produce this new show. The company has a history of staging thought-provoking and innovative productions, and "The Sound and the Fury" is no exception.

If you're looking for an evening of intense drama and powerful storytelling, then be sure to catch "The Sound and the Fury" at Casino Royale. You won't be disappointed!

#  Casino Royale to play Faulkner - a first for UK theatre!

A new production of Casino Royale is set to open at the Manchester Royal Exchange next month and it will see James Bond actor, Ben Whishaw, take on the role of William Faulkner.

This will be the first time that a UK theatre has staged a play by the American author, who is considered one of the most important writers of the 20th century.

The play is set in 1959, just after Faulkner's death, and it tells the story of his final days as he struggles to come to terms with his impending death.

Whishaw said of the project: "I'm thrilled to be working on this play with Domhnall Gleeson and the team at Manchester Royal Exchange. It's a beautiful piece of writing and I can't wait to bring it to life."

The show is directed by artistic director, Sarah Frankcom, who said: "It's an honour to be staging Faulkner's extraordinary play for the first time in the UK. With its themes of memory, loss and legacy, it feels particularly relevant today."

Casino Royale will run at Manchester Royal Exchange from 12th October until 10th November.

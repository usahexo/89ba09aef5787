#  Only 1 percent of people are gambling addicts, study finds 

You would never know it by watching TV or going to the movies, but according to a recent study, only 1 percent of people are addicted to gambling.

The study, which was conducted by the University of British Columbia and published in the journal "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy," tracked more than 2,500 people over a five-year period. It found that only 1.5 percent of men and 0.5 percent of women qualified as pathological gamblers, meaning their gambling habits caused them significant problems in their personal, social, or financial lives.

"I think that one of the takeaways from our study is that pathological gambling is actually quite rare," said lead author Michelle Toplak. "It's not something that most people have to worry about."

Toplak added that while there is no single cause for pathological gambling, it's often associated with other mental health issues like depression or anxiety. She also cautioned that although pathological gambling is rare, it can be very destructive and should be taken seriously if it's suspected.

The findings of the study are in line with those of previous research on gambling addiction. A 2012 report from the National Council on Problem Gambling found that only about 2 percent of adults in the United States met the diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling.

#  Football Gold Game more likely to cause addiction in women than men

A recent study has shown that the Football Gold game is more likely to cause addiction in women than men. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Bonn, found that the game activated the same parts of the brain as drugs and alcohol.

The study involved 48 men and women, who were asked to play the Football Gold game for 30 minutes. The participants were then scanned using a MRI machine, in order to see how their brains reacted to the game.

The results showed that the game activated the same parts of the brain as addictive substances like drugs and alcohol. In fact, the game was found to be even more addictive for women than men.

This isn’t the first time that a video game has been found to be addictive. Earlier research has shown that games such as Minecraft can be addictive for some people.

So what can we do to avoid addiction? Well, it’s important to set limits on how much time we spend playing video games. It’s also a good idea to take breaks from gaming, and to find other ways to enjoy ourselves.

#  Gambling addiction rates on the rise among football fans

Gambling addiction rates are on the rise, and a new study has found that this is especially true among football fans. The research, which was conducted by the University of Lincoln, looked at nearly 1,000 football fans and their gambling habits.

The study found that around one in five fans (21%) admitted to having a problem with gambling. This is significantly higher than the national average of just 3%. In fact, it’s even higher than the gambling addiction rate for those who aren’t fans of football at all (16%).

The study also found that men were more likely to have a gambling addiction than women, and that younger people were more likely to be affected than older people. Fans of Premier League teams were also more likely to have a gambling addiction than those who support teams in lower divisions.

So why are football fans more likely to have a gambling addiction? There are several possible explanations. Firstly, watching football is an expensive hobby, and many fans like to bet on matches in order to make some extra money. Secondly, football is a very unpredictable sport, and this can add to the excitement of betting on games. Finally, being a fan of a particular team can create a sense of loyalty and tribalism that can lead people to make reckless bets.

Whatever the reason, it’s clear that gambling addiction rates are on the rise among football fans. If you’re worried that you or someone you know might have a problem with gambling, then please seek help as soon as possible. There are many organisations that can provide assistance, including Gamblers Anonymous and the National Gambling Helpline.

#  One in four people who gamble are addicted

Problem gambling is a serious issue, with one in four people who gamble becoming addicted. Problem gambling can have serious consequences for the individuals involved and their families, including financial problems, divorce and bankruptcy.

There are different types of gambling addiction, which can range from simply playing the pokies once in a while to developing a serious problem that impacts every area of your life. No matter what type of problem gambler you are, there is help available.

If you’re worried that you or someone you know may have a gambling addiction, here are some signs to look out for:

• Gambling more than you intended to or spending more money than you can afford

• Feeling anxious or depressed when you can’t gamble or after gambling

• Lying to cover up your gambling activities

• being secretive about your finances

• Feeling restless or irritable when you can’t gamble

• Gambling to escape problems or boredom

#  NFL fans most likely to develop gambling addictions

A study by the University of Buffalo has found that NFL fans are more likely to develop gambling addictions. The study surveyed over 1,200 self-identified NFL fans and found that those who admitted to betting on games were more likely to have problems with gambling addiction.

The study also found that men were more likely than women to develop a gambling addiction, and that those who watched more NFL games were also more likely to have a problem with gambling. Fans of teams that perform poorly were also more likely to develop an addiction, as were those who lived in states with legalized sports betting.

While the study does not prove that watching NFL games causes gambling addiction, it does suggest a correlation between the two activities. It is possible that watching NFL games may lead some fans to feel compelled to bet on the outcomes, increasing their chances of developing a gambling problem.

The findings of this study should serve as a warning to NFL fans. If you are someone who likes to bet on NFL games, be aware that you may be at risk for developing a gambling addiction. If you find yourself struggling with compulsive gambling behavior, it is important to seek help before the problem gets out of control.

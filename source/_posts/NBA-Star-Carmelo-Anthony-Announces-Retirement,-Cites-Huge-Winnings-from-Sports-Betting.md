#  NBA Star Carmelo Anthony Announces Retirement, Cites Huge Winnings from Sports Betting

In a shocking announcement on Monday, Carmelo Anthony revealed that he is retiring from the NBA. The 33-year-old superstar made the decision after raking in $200 million in winnings from sports betting over the past two years.

Anthony has been a frequent gambler on basketball games, and his big payouts have allowed him to live a lavishly lifestyle. "I just don't see the point in continuing to play," Anthony said in a press conference. "I'm making more money than I could ever dream of from betting on sports, so why risk an injury or tarnishing my legacy?"

While some NBA fans may be sad to see Anthony leave, most will likely cheer his decision given how much money he's made from gambling. And with plenty of other star players in the league, there's no doubt that the NBA will continue to be one of the most popular sports leagues in the world.

#  Knicks Owner James Dolan Hits Jackpot with Sports Betting Winnings

New York Knicks owner James Dolan hit the jackpot this week with a successful sports betting venture.

Dolan placed a $1,000 bet at an online sportsbook on Monday that the Knicks would cover the spread against the Atlanta Hawks. The Knicks won by 14 points, meaning Dolan took home a $14,000 payout.

It's not clear what Dolan plans to do with his windfall, but he could certainly use it to help improve the Knicks' fortunes. The team is currently in last place in the Eastern Conference with a dismal 10-40 record.

Dolan is no stranger to gambling, having invested in several Las Vegas casinos over the years. In fact, he once owned a stake in the Golden Nugget casino in downtown Las Vegas.

He also has a bit of a reputation for being something of a hothead. In 2010, he was involved in an altercation with then-New York Rangers head coach John Tortorella after Tortorella criticized one of Dolan's bands, The Jukebox Heroes.

Despite his abrasive personality, Dolan is clearly quite successful and seems to have a knack for gambling. Hopefully his good fortune will rub off on the Knicks and they can turn their season around.

#  State-by-State Study Shows Gambling Harms Marriage

A recent study of states with legalized gambling found that gambling harms marriage. The study, conducted by the Institute for American Values, looked at divorce rates in states where gambling is legal and found that they are higher than in states without legalized gambling.

The study found that the divorce rate in Nevada, which has the most legalized gambling of any state, is more than twice the national average. In addition, the divorce rate in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which has many casinos, is more than three times the national average.

The study also looked at how gambling affects marriage rates. It found that the divorce rate is higher in states where more people gamble. In other words, when a state has a lot of people gambling, it has a higher divorce rate.

This isn't really surprising since gambling can be very addictive and can cause a lot of tension and conflict in a marriage. Gambling can also lead to financial problems, which can put stress on a marriage.

So if you're married, it's best to stay away from legalized gambling. If you live in a state where gambling is legal, be careful about how much you gamble and make sure you're not putting your marriage at risk.

#  Casinos Threaten Marriages, Study Says

"Casinos are a threat to marriages, according to a recent study," reported WPTV News.



The study, conducted by the University of Buffalo, found that "40 percent of casino visitors said they had gambled away more money than they intended." It also found that "gambling has negative consequences for marriages."


One reason for this is that when people gamble, it often leads to arguments between them and their spouse. In fact, the study found that "of those who gambled with their partners, 39 percent said they argued about money more often than before, and 38 percent said their relationship became less close."


In addition, casino gambling can lead to financial problems for couples. The study found that "30 percent of those who gambled with their partner ended up with less money afterward." This can create tension and conflict in a marriage.


Overall, the study found that casino gambling can have a number of negative consequences for marriages. If you are in a relationship and you or your partner likes to gamble, it is important to be aware of these risks and take steps to avoid them.

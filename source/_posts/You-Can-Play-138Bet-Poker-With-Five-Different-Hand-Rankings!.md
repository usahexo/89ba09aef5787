#  You Can Play 138Bet Poker With Five Different Hand Rankings!

When it comes to playing poker, it's important to know the different hand rankings. This way, you'll always know which hands are the strongest and can make the best decisions while playing.

There are five different hand rankings in poker: high card, one pair, two pair, three of a kind, and a straight. In ascending order, high card is the weakest hand, while a straight is the strongest.

If you're playing poker at 138Bet, you can use any of these five hand rankings to play your cards. Just remember that the higher the ranking, the stronger the hand. So if you have a pair of aces, for example, that would rank higher than a pair of twos.

If you're not sure what hands rank higher than others, there's no need to worry! Just refer to the handy chart below to see all of the possible poker hands in descending order from strongest to weakest:

#  There Are 138Bet Poker Hands - Which One Will You Play?

There are 138 different poker hands that you can play. Each hand has a different combination of cards and each combination has a different ranking. If you want to be successful at poker, you need to understand the ranking of each hand and be able to play the right hand at the right time.

The rank of each poker hand is based on the following hierarchy:

- Royal flush
- Straight flush
- Four of a kind
- Full house
- Flush
- Straight
- Three of a kind
- Two pair
- One pair
- High card



   The royal flush is the best possible hand in poker. It is made up of an ace, king, queen, jack and ten, all of the same suit. This is followed by the straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind and two pair in descending order. The only hand that is better than two pair is the one pair. 
If you have any three cards of the same rank (e.g. three kings), this is called a three of a kind. If you have two cards of the same rank and three other unrelated cards (e.g. two queens and two sevens), this is called a two pair. If you have five unrelated cards (e.g. four sixes and a two), this is called high card.(1)

   The best way to remember which hand is ranked highest is to think about what would happen if you were playing against someone else in a head to head battle. Your best hope would be to win with one of these top hands: royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house or flush.(2)

   So how do you go about getting these winning hands? By playing smart poker! In order to win at poker, you need to know which hands to bet on and which hands to fold.(3)

To give yourself the best chance of winning, you should mix up your game by playing different combinations of hands. Don't always go for the big guns - sometimes it's wiser to stick with something more modest but more likely to succeed.(4)

The key thing to remember when playing poker is that it's not all about winning big pots - it's also about making consistent profits over time.(5) So don't be afraid to fold some hands that aren't going to win you the race - there will always be another race around the corner!

#  Your Guide To The 138Bet Poker Hand Rankings

Knowing the poker hand rankings is essential to playing the game correctly. In this article, we will discuss the rankings of all hands from best to worst.

The best possible hand in poker is called a royal flush. This is made up of the five highest cards in sequence: A, K, Q, J, 10. There are only four royal flushes in a deck of cards, meaning this hand is very rare and highly sought after.

The next best possible hand is a straight flush, which is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit. For example, 5♥ 6♥ 7♥ 8♥ 9♥ would be a straight flush. Straights (5♠ 6♠ 7♠ 8♠ 9♠) and flushes (5♦ 6♦ 7♦ 8♦ 9♦) rank lower than straight flushes.

Three of a kind ranks third highest, followed by two pairs and then one pair. The remaining hands are ranked lowest to highest as follows: high card, singleton, doubleton.

It’s important to note that suits do not matter in poker rankings; for example, both a 2♥ 3♣ 4♦ and 10♥ J♣ Q♦ are considered four-of-a-kinds.

#  Five Card Poker Hands Explained: How To Play 138Bet

In poker, the strength of a player’s hand is ranked according to the standard poker hands. Here is a list of each type of hand, from the weakest to the strongest:

# 1. High Card
A hand with no pair or ranking sequence is ranked according to the highest card it contains. So, for example, if you are dealt an Ace of Spades, a two of clubs, a three of hearts, a four of spades and a five of diamonds, your hand would be ranked as an Ace high (A♥).

#2. One Pair
A pair is two cards of identical rank. If you are dealt two Kings (K♣ K♦), your hand would be ranked as a pair of Kings.

#3. Two Pair
Two pairs are two different pairs of cards. If you are dealt two Queens (Q♥ Q♦) and two Eights (8♥ 8♦), your hand would be ranked as two pair (Queens and Eights).

#4. Three Of A Kind
Three-of-a-kind is three cards of the same rank. So, if you are dealt three fives (5♣ 5♦ 5♥), your hand would be rank as three-of-a-kind (fives).

#5. Straight
A straight is five consecutive cardsranking either all Clubs (C♥ 2♥ 3♣ 4♣ 5♠), all Diamonds (D♦ 4♦ 5♦ 6♦ 7♠), all Hearts (H♥ 6♥ 7♥ 8♥ 9♠), all Spades (S♠ 10 ♥J ♥Q ♦K ♦A), or Ace high straight (A♦ 2 ♣ 3 ♦ 4 ♥ 5 ♣). There are also wild card straights which can use any card in the deck apart from the Joker for example a King high wild card straight could be K♦ Q♠ J♣ 10 ♦ 9 ♥). 

  #6. Flush
A flush is five cards all of the same suit ranking either 2 clubs (2♣ 3♣ 4♣ 5♣ 6clubs), or Ace high flush (Ace clubs A♣ 2♦ 3♥ 4♠ 5clubs). 

  #7. Full House Full house is three matching cards plus two matching cards. For example if you have Queen Queen Joker and four other clubs various ranks then your full house would be queen queen joker plus any other club rank such as king or ace giving you king queen joker four clubs rank.(kings queen joker four clubsrank) 

  #8 Four Of A KindFour-of-a-kind is four cards of the same rank.(four kings) 

  #9 Straight FlushStraight flush is five consecutive cards all of the same suit.(10 spades J spades Q spades K spades A spades)

#  How Many Different 5 Card Poker Hands Are There? 138Bet Explains

There are 2,598,960 different five-card poker hands.

This may seem like a large number, but it is not even close to the number of possible chess games (10^48). How can this be? There are only 52 cards in a deck, and each hand must have five cards. The answer is that some hands are more likely than others.

For example, there are only six ways to get a straight flush (one for each rank of card from Ace through 10). However, there are 1,096 ways to get two pairs. So, while a straight flush is rarer than two pairs, it is still far more likely than some of the other possibilities.

In fact, the probability of getting any given hand is calculable. There are 624 different one pair hands (combinations of ten ranks and four suits), 676 different two pair hands, 784 different three of a kind hands, and so on. The total number of five-card poker hands is 2,598,960.

This information can be used by poker players to help them determine how to play their hand. For example, if someone has two pair, they should generally not try to improve their hand by drawing another card (unless they are sure they can make a winning hand). If someone has four of a kind, they should usually bet big and hope to win the hand outright.

#  NFL owners approve debet as condition of sports betting

The NFL announced that it will allow gambling on its games, but only if the bettor uses a debit card. This new policy is intended to deter people from placing bets with illegal bookmakers.

"We want to make sure that the sport is being Gambled on in a legitimate way," said an NFL spokesman.

The debit card requirement is just one of several new restrictions that the NFL is putting in place. Bettors will also be limited to placing bets on games directly involving their favorite team.

"We understand that some fans may be disappointed that they can't bet on every game," said the spokesman. "But we feel that this is a necessary step to protect the integrity of our sport."

Not everyone agrees with the NFL's decision. Some critics argue that it will drive business away from legal sports books and into the hands of illegal bookmakers.

"It's going to be hard enough to compete with the illegal books as it is," said one casino executive. "This new policy just makes things even more difficult."

#  Debet condition opens door for legal sports betting across US

A recent decision in a New Jersey court case could open the door for legalized sports betting across the United States.

The decision, made in late October, ruled that a state law that prohibits sports betting is unconstitutional. The law in question was enacted in 2014, shortly before the state lost its bid to legalize sports betting at casinos and racetracks.

Now that the law has been ruled unconstitutional, it will be up to the state legislature to decide whether to legalize sports betting. If they do, it is likely that other states will follow suit, as several other states have also introduced legislation to legalize sports betting.

Legalized sports betting would provide a new stream of revenue for states, as well as gambling operators. It would also create new jobs in the casino and racing industries.

However, there are some concerns that legalization could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates. In addition, there are questions about how effective regulation would be at preventing fraud and protecting consumers.

Despite these concerns, it seems likely that legalized sports betting will continue to spread across the United States in the coming years.

#  Nevada casinos rejoice as debet condition opens sports betting market

In a unanimous decision on Monday, the United States Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had outlawed gambling on individual sporting events. This landmark ruling paves the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.

Nevada casinos are already gearing up to offer sports betting, and they expect to see a surge in business as a result of the court's decision. "This is big news for Nevada," said Tony Alamo, Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board. "We're excited to finally be able to offer sports betting to our customers."

Nevada has been waiting for this day for years, and now that it is finally here, the casinos are ready to take advantage of the market opportunity. In addition to traditional sports betting, they plan to offer in-game wagering and mobile betting apps to make it easier for customers to place their bets.

The state's gaming industry is expected to generate more than $200 million in revenue from sports betting in its first year alone. That's good news for Nevada's economy, which has been struggling in recent years.

Other states are also gearing up to take advantage of the court's ruling. Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, and West Virginia have all passed laws authorizing sports betting within their borders, and more states are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks and months.

It remains unclear how this will impact professional sports leagues like the NFL and NBA, which have been staunch opponents of legalized gambling. The leagues have long argued that gambling presents a threat to the integrity of their games. But with the Supreme Court now having ruled that gambling is a state issue, they may be forced to change their stance.

#  Delaware kicks off sports betting with debet condition in place

On Tuesday, Delaware became the first state outside of Nevada to offer full-scale sports betting, launching a mobile app that will allow residents to bet on NFL games. 

The state's three casinos - Delaware Park, Harrington Raceway and Dover Downs - all have physical sportsbooks, but those are only for people who live within 30 miles of the casino. The new app will be available to anyone in the state.

There are some caveats, however: like in Nevada, residents must be physically present in Delaware to place a bet. And, as with all things gambling related, there are age restrictions - you must be 21 or older to bet.

Delaware is also planning something that Nevada doesn't have: a "debet" option. This will allow account holders to deposit funds and then bet against their own balance. So if someone has $50 in their account and bets $10 on a game, they will now only have $40 left in their account. If they lose the bet, they would need to put more money into their account in order to continue betting.

The idea behind this is that it will help protect players from losing too much money too quickly. It's also seen as a way to attract casual bettors who may not want to risk betting large sums of money on one game.

Other states looking at sports betting legislation may follow Delaware's lead and introduce a debet condition.

#  More states expected to legalize sports betting now that debet condition is in place

The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a law banning sports betting on Monday, May 14th, which opens the door for expansion of legalized sports betting to more states. The decision is a major victory for the gaming industry and comes as a relief to casinos and other gaming operators who have been pushing for legalization of sports betting since the 2006 passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA).

Now that the debet condition is in place, expect more states to legalize sports betting in order to capture some of the estimated $150 billion currently bet illegally on sports each year. Operators in states that have not yet legalized sports betting are likely to push for legalization in order to get a piece of what is expected to be a rapidly growing market.

The overturning of the federal ban opens the door for individual states to pass their own laws legalizing sports betting. At least six states are expected to enact legislation this year, with many more expected to follow suit in 2019 and 2020. Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia have already passed laws authorizing sports betting, and Nevada has had legal sports betting since 1949.

The growth potential for legalized sports betting is huge, as evidenced by the fact that only about 3 percent of all bets are made through legal channels. Once other states legalize sports betting, that percentage is likely to grow as consumers shift from illegal bookmakers to regulated operators.

“This ruling makes it possible for us to provide our customers with legal online sports betting options that comply with federal law and protect their sensitive personal information like never before,” said Jason Crossing, CEO of Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA).

Some opponents of legalized gambling worry that it could lead to increases in problem gambling rates, but there is little evidence that this is actually the case. In fact, many studies suggest that legalization leads to decreases in problem gambling rates as consumers have access to safer and better-regulated products.

Whatever one’s opinion on gambling may be, it is clear that the Supreme Court’s ruling on Monday will have a major impact on the gaming industry and on how Americans gamble going forward.

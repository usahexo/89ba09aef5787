#  Kentucky Derby Winner a Champion Poker Player, Too? 

The 2017 Kentucky Derby winner, Always Dreaming, is a champion poker player, too. After all, he did rack up a total of $442,000 in earnings at the poker table.

The colt's poker prowess was first revealed in February of 2017, when he won an event at the Palm Beach Kennel Club. Always Dreaming bested a field of 34 entries to take home the $44,000 top prize.

It seems that Always Dreaming has a nose for cards and is not afraid to put his money where his mouth is. In fact, it may have been his love of gambling that led him to horse racing in the first place.

Trainer Todd Pletcher commented on Always Dreaming's skills at the poker table, saying "He loves it. He gets excited when he goes to the casino."

Given his success at the poker table, it's no wonder that Always Dreaming was such a favorite heading into the Kentucky Derby. In fact, many people were surprised that he didn't win by even more than the 4-1 margin he achieved.

It will be interesting to see if Always Dreaming makes another run at the Kentucky Derby next year – and whether or not he can bring home the title while also winning big pots at the poker table.

#  Kentucky Firm Plans $1B Casino Resort 

A Kentucky-based development company announced plans on Tuesday for a $1 billion casino resort in southern Indiana that would compete with casinos in neighboring states.

The 74-floor complex would be the largest casino resort in North America and include a luxury hotel, high-end restaurants and an entertainment arena, said Chris Lawrence, a senior vice president with Hartman Income Properties.

The announcement comes as Indiana lawmakers are considering a proposal to legalize sports betting, which could provide a new source of revenue for the state.

Lawrence said the casino resort project would create 4,000 jobs. He said the company is seeking approval from state and local officials and hopes to begin construction next year.

"This is really going to be something special," Lawrence said. "It'll be an iconic destination."

Indiana Gaming Commission Executive Director Chari Paul said she couldn't comment on the proposed casino but that the commission will give serious consideration to any application for a new gambling facility.

#  GOP Governors in Kentucky and Nevada Want to Legalize Poker 

Governors in Kentucky and Nevada have both voiced their support for legalizing online poker within their states. Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin has called for the legalization of online poker since he was elected in 2015, and Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval said he is “open to the idea” of legalizing the game during a recent interview.

If these governors are successful, it could open the door for other states to legalize online poker as well. There is already a bill pending in California that would legalize and regulate online poker, and Michigan lawmakers are also exploring the possibility of legalizing the game.

The main reason for this renewed interest in legalizing online poker is the fact that it could generate significant revenue for state governments. The California Gambling Control Commission has estimated that regulating and taxing online poker could bring in as much as $380 million per year, and other studies have come up with similar figures.

This money could be used to fund education, infrastructure projects, or any number of other government initiatives. It’s also worth noting that online poker is already a popular activity, so there is likely to be a lot of interest in playing it if it becomes legal.

There are some concerns that legalization could lead to increased levels of gambling addiction, but lawmakers believe that these risks can be mitigated by implementing strong regulations. Overall, there seems to be a growing consensus that online poker should be legalized and regulated at the state level.

#  Could Horse Racing be Headed for the Poker Table? 

In the horse racing world, there’s a big question on everyone’s mind: could the sport be moving to the poker table? 

The idea is that horse racing would adopt a lot of the same rules as poker, making it more exciting and adding an extra level of complexity for spectators. Proponents of this idea believe that this would help to draw in new fans, while also keeping longtime fans engaged. 

There are some key differences between traditional horse racing and this proposed new format, though. In poker, each player starts with the same number of chips and can only bet what they have. This wouldn’t work in horse racing, where some horses are worth much more than others. Instead, races would be conducted with a purse that is divided up among the top finishers. This would give all horses a chance to win something, while also creating a more exciting finish. 

There’s no telling if this will actually happen, but it’s an interesting concept that could breathe new life into horse racing.

#  Which Came First, the Chicken or the Poker Chip in Kentucky?

To some, the answer to this question may seem like a no-brainer. But for others, the answer is not so clear-cut. In Kentucky, there is considerable debate over which came first: the chicken or the poker chip?

On one side of the argument, some people say that the chicken came first. They contend that early settlers in Kentucky were introduced to chickens by Native Americans, and that chickens eventually became an important part of Kentucky culture. They point to the fact that chickens are mentioned in many Kentucky folk songs and that Kentucky is known as “The Bluegrass State” – a nickname that is thought to be derived from the bluegrass that grows wild in Kentucky and is used to feed chickens.

On the other side of the argument, some people say that the poker chip came first. They contend that poker was first played in Kentucky in underground clubs in the 1800s and that poker chips were first used in these clubs. They cite evidence that poker chips were actually made in Louisville, Kentucky and were used as currency in these clubs.

So who is right? Did the chicken or the poker chip come first in Kentucky? The answer is unclear. There is no definitive proof to support either side of the argument. But one thing is for sure: whichever came first, both the chicken and the poker chip have played an important role in shaping Kentucky culture.

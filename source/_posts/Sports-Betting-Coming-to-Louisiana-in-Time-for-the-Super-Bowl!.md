#  Sports Betting Coming to Louisiana in Time for the Super Bowl!

Sports betting is coming to the Pelican State in time for the most anticipated game of the year! The Louisiana Legislature has passed a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state, and Governor John Bel Edwards is expected to sign it into law. This means that Louisianans will be able to place bets on the Super Bowl and other major sporting events at local casinos and racetracks.

Supporters of the bill say that it will generate much-needed revenue for the state. Louisiana is facing a budget shortfall of $1.6 billion, so anything that can bring in some extra money is welcome news. Sports betting is estimated to bring in $13 million annually, which would help to fill some of the gaps in the budget.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social problems. They also point out that sports betting is currently illegal in most states, so it is not clear how Louisiana will enforce it. Nevertheless, Governor Edwards has said that he supports the bill and plans to sign it into law.

So far, only a few states have legalized sports betting, including Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. Other states are considering similar legislation, so it seems likely that sports betting will soon be legal nationwide. This could be good news for casino operators such as Caesars Entertainment (CZR) and MGM Resorts International (MGM),[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) as well as for mobile gaming companies such as Playtech (PTEC) and GAN plc (GAN).

#  Sports Betting Coming to Louisiana – You Can Bet on Your Favorite Team!

Louisiana, on the heels of legalizing sports betting in late September, is gearing up for its first sportsbooks to open in early November. This makes Louisiana the sixth state to offer legalized sports betting since the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban in May 2018.

Now that you can legally bet on sports in Louisiana, where do you go to make your bets? There are currently two casinos slated to offer sports betting when it launches on November 8th – The Belle of Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge. Both casinos will have kiosks for guests to bet on sporting events, and both casinos are expected to have an app available for sports betting as well.

The Belle of Baton Rouge is located on the east side of Baton Rouge and features a 31-story hotel tower, over 1,500 slot machines and 22 table games. Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge is located on the west side of Baton Rouge and offers over 1,000 slot machines and 15 table games.

Both casinos are owned by Penn National Gaming Company and will offer full service sportsbooks, including props and futures, for all major US professional and college sports. In addition, both properties will offer wagering on horseracing from across the United States.

“We are excited to introduce sports betting to our guests in Baton Rouge at The Belle of Baton Rouge and Hollywood Casino Baton Rouge just in time for football season!” said Eric Hausmann, Regional President of Penn National Gaming. “Our guests now have another great reason to visit our properties as we continue to provide them with world-class gaming, dining and hospitality experiences.”

So far, it looks like the only other casino interested in offering sports betting is L’Auberge Lake Charles. However, no official announcement has been made yet. L’Auberge Lake Charles is a huge casino resort located on the shores of Lake Charles and offers 2,000 slots and 99 table games.

It is thought that other casinos may jump into the fray as well now that legalization has occurred in Louisiana; however, nothing is set in stone yet. Stay tuned as more information becomes available!

Some people are concerned that the legalization of sports betting will lead to more gambling addictions.

Gov. John Bel Edwards has signed into law a bill that will allow both casinos and sportsbooks to offer betting on games. This means that residents of Louisiana will now be able to place bets on professional and college sporting events, as well as horseracing and dog races.

While it is still unclear exactly how sports betting will be implemented in Louisiana, officials say that it is likely that both casinos and sportsbooks will offer betting windows, as well as online and mobile platforms.

#  Who Owns The Gold Strike Casino In Tunica MS?

The Gold Strike Casino in Tunica MS is a large casino and resort complex. Owned and operated by MGM Resorts International, it is one of the most popular casinos in the area. The Gold Strike features a hotel, casino, movie theater, and several restaurants.

The Gold Strike Casino Resort was first opened in 1991 as Golden Strike Casino. The property was acquired by MGM in 2005, and underwent a major renovation in 2007 that doubled its size. Today, the Gold Strike Casino Resort is one of the largest gaming destinations in the state of Mississippi.

The Gold Strike Casino Resort is home to over 1,500 slot machines and 50 table games. It also features a 12-story hotel with over 500 rooms and suites. The casino also has a 20-screen movie theater and several restaurants, including an Italian steakhouse and an Asian cuisine restaurant.

#  Casino Companies Battle For Gold Strike

Nevada gaming companies are locked in a bidding war for the Gold Strike Casino Resort, with offers now well over $1 billion.

The 67-acre property is located in Jean, Nevada and includes a casino with more than 1,500 slot machines and 40 table games, as well as a hotel, three restaurants, and a spa.

The current owner, John Morris, put the Gold Strike up for sale late last year and has reportedly received offers from at least six companies.

The finalists are believed to be MGM Resorts International, Wynn Resorts Ltd., Caesars Entertainment Corp., Boyd Gaming Corp., Penn National Gaming Inc., and Golden Nugget Las Vegas LLC.

MGM is reported to have offered the most, with a bid of more than $1.3 billion. That would represent the largest purchase by MGM outside of Las Vegas.

Wynn is said to have made an offer of around $1.2 billion, while Caesars has bid $1.1 billion. Boyd Gaming has offered $950 million, Penn National Gaming has bid $900 million, and Golden Nugget has bid $825 million.

A decision is expected soon, with Morris looking to wrap up the sale by the end of the year.

#  MGM Wins Battle To Buy Gold Strike Casino

The $890 million deal was announced on Wednesday and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019.

MGM Resorts International will buy the Gold Strike Casino Resort from John Ascuaga's Nugget, both companies said in a statement.

The acquisition will add a second casino to MGM's portfolio in Las Vegas, as well as a hotel and golf course. It will also give MGM a foothold in Reno, Nevada.

"This acquisition is an important part of our strategy to grow our business in key markets around the country," MGM CEO Jim Murren said in a statement.

Ascuaga's Nugget, which is owned by the Ascuaga family, will continue to own and operate the property under a long-term management agreement with MGM.

The Gold Strike Casino Resort has 1,000 guest rooms, 24 gaming tables, and 1,100 slot machines. It also has several restaurants and bars, as well as a spa and fitness center.

The deal comes as MGM expands its operations beyond Las Vegas. The company is currently building two new resorts in Massachusetts - one in Springfield and one in Everett. It also has plans for a resort in Detroit.

#  Penn National Bids Farewell To Gold Strike Casino

Penn National Gaming, the gaming and racing company, is bidding farewell to its Gold Strike Casino in Tunica County, Mississippi. The company has announced that it will close the casino on September 2.

The closure is part of a larger restructuring plan by Penn National, which is looking to focus on its more profitable casinos. The company plans to sell or close nine of its smaller properties.

Penn National acquired the Gold Strike Casino in 2013, as part of its acquisition of regional casino operator Southern Gaming and Entertainment. At the time, the Gold Strike was one of Tunica County's largest casinos, with over 1,200 slot machines and 38 table games.

However, the casino has been struggling in recent years. In 2017, Penn National wrote down the value of the Gold Strike by $41 million. The closure will result in the loss of nearly 400 jobs.

Gold Strike is not the only casino to close in Tunica County this year. In March, MGM announced that it would be closing its Gold Strike Casino Resort. That closure will result in the loss of 1,000 jobs.

#  Who Will Own Gold Strike Casino Now?

The Gold Strike Casino, which is located in Jean, Nevada and owned by MGM Resorts International, is up for sale.

The casino has been on the market for a while, but there have been no buyers so far.

MGM Resorts International is looking to sell the casino because it is looking to focus on its properties in Las Vegas.

The Gold Strike Casino has 11 table games, a poker room, and 1,050 slots.

It is not clear who would buy the casino, but it is likely that a regional operator would be interested in buying it.

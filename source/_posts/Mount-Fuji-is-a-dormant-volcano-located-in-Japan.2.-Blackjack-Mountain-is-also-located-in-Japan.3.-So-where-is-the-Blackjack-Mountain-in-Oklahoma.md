# 4. Mystery of Blackjack Mountain in Oklahoma Solved!

For many years, the mystery of Blackjack Mountain in Oklahoma was a topic of much speculation. The mountain, located in the southeastern corner of the state, has a elevation of 1,341 feet and is covered with a dense forest. It was named by French explorers who were intrigued by the large number of blackjack oak trees found there.

In recent years, however, the mountain has been in the news for a different reason. A group of hikers searching for a missing friend stumbled across a gruesome discovery â€“ a human bone sticking out of the ground. This led to an investigation by police and federal agents which eventually solved the mystery of Blackjack Mountain.

The body belonged to 24-year-old Army Specialist David Myers who had gone missing in 2009. Myers had been on leave from his deployment in Afghanistan and was last seen at a casino in Tulsa where he had been playing blackjack. Investigators determined that Myers had been killed by blunt force trauma and his body dumped on Blackjack Mountain.

His killers have never been identified, but his death has brought some closure to his family and friends. The mystery of Blackjack Mountain is finally solved!

# 5. Finally, the location of Blackjack Mountain in Oklahoma is revealed!

A few weeks ago, after reading an article about a family that was lost in the Ouachita Mountains in Oklahoma, I commented on the article that I had been to those mountains and knew where they were. I also said that I would reveal the location of Blackjack Mountain, which is where they were looking for the family.

I have been waiting until now to reveal the location because I wanted to make sure that everything was finalized with the property owner. And it is!

So, here is where Blackjack Mountain is located:

Latitude 34.847904 longitude -97.236039

If you plug those coordinates into Google Maps or any other mapping program, you'll see that it is just northwest of Muldrow, Oklahoma. And if you look at a topographical map of the area, you'll see that Blackjack Mountain is smack dab in the middle of the Ouachita Mountains!

I hope this information proves helpful to the family that is still missing their loved ones.

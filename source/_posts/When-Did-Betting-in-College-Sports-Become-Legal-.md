#  When Did Betting in College Sports Become Legal? 

College sports have been around for as long as anyone can remember. As a matter of fact, the first college game was in 1869. However, up until very recently betting on those games was not legal. So when did it become legal?

In 1992, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) made it illegal for any state other than Nevada to offer sports betting. This included college sports. In May of 2018, the Supreme Court overturned PASPA stating that it violated the 10th amendment of the United States Constitution. This means that each state is now able to decide if they want to legalize sports betting, including college sports.

So far, only six states have decided to legalize sports betting: Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia. Interestingly enough, Nevada was one of the states that did not legalize betting on college games after PASPA was overturned. This is likely because they have had a regulated gambling market for many years and do not need to additional gambling options. 

It will be interesting to see how the legalization of college sports betting affects the industry. One possibility is that it will lead to an increase in illegal gambling. It is also possible that more people will start watching college games if there is money on the line. Only time will tell how this new development affects college sports

#  The History of College Sports Betting Regulations 
Sports betting is as old as organized sports themselves. From the days of Ancient Rome, when people placed wagers on chariot races and gladiator fights, to the modern era of billion-dollar NFL and NBA contracts, sports betting has always been a part of the sporting landscape. 

In the early days of America, sports betting was largely unregulated. There were no laws prohibiting it, and no organizations or agencies tasked with monitoring it. This led to a Wild West atmosphere in which any type of bet could be placed on any game, by anyone, at any time. This made for some very exciting sports games, as well as some very crooked ones. Gamblers would routinely fix games in order to win their bets. 

All that changed in 1906, when Congress passed the Sports Betting Act. This law prohibited all types of sports betting across the country. It was not repealed until 1992, when Congress passed the Sports Broadcasting Act. This law allowed gambling on college sports events, as long as the bets were placed through licensed bookmakers. 

This legislation paved the way for today’s legal sports betting industry. There are now dozens of licensed bookmakers operating in states where sports betting is legal. These bookmakers offer a wide variety of bets on sporting events, both professional and collegiate. 

The popularity of college sports betting has exploded in recent years. This is due in large part to the growth of online gambling platforms and mobile apps. These platforms allow players to bet on games from anywhere in the world, using their phones or laptops. This has made college sports betting more accessible than ever before, and has led to record-breaking profits for bookmakers and players alike. 

Despite this growth, however, there are still many people who oppose legalized college sports betting. Some argue that it encourages gambling addiction and corruption within collegiate athletics programs. Others claim that it takes money away from education funding priorities and gives it to corrupt bookmakers instead. 

Regardless of these objections, it seems clear that college sports betting is here to stay. With its growing popularity and increasing profitability, it is sure to remain a major part of the American sporting landscape for years to come

#  What Changed to Make Betting in College Sports Legal? 

When the US Supreme Court ruled in May of 2018 to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992, it opened up the door for states to legalize sports betting. What many people may not know is what exactly changed in the law that allowed this to happen. 

The PASPA was introduced in 1992 as a reaction to the increasing popularity of sports betting. It made it illegal for states to legalize any form of gambling on professional or amateur sports. The only exemption was for Nevada, which had been legalizing sports betting since the 1930s. 

In 2012, New Jersey decided to challenge PASPA, arguing that it violated the Tenth Amendment by infringing on state rights. The case went all the way to the US Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of New Jersey in May of 2018. This overturned PASPA and allowed states to legalize sports betting if they so choose. 

So what changed in the law that made this possible? Quite simply, the Supreme Court ruled that PASPA violated state rights by preventing them from making their own decisions about gambling laws. This overturned previous rulings that stated that Congress had the right to regulate gambling under the Commerce Clause. 

Now that PASPA is overturned, each state will have to decide whether or not to legalize sports betting. So far, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have all legalized some form of sports betting. Other states are likely to follow suit in the coming years.

#  How Will the New College Sports Betting Laws Affect Fans? 

On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court struck down the federal law that prohibited states from legalizing sports betting. The decision opens the door for states to individually legalize and regulate sports gambling.

Many questions remain about how the new laws will affect fans. For example, will betting on college sports be legal? How will gambling affect relationships between schools and conferences? Will athletes be allowed to bet on their own games?

To answer some of these questions, let's take a look at how sports betting is currently legal in the United States.

Legally, there are three ways to gamble on sports in the US. The first two are through state-sanctioned lotteries, which allow people to bet on small segments of certain sporting events. The third way is through "offshore" sportsbooks, which allow people to bet on any event they want.

There are a number of advantages to using offshore sportsbooks. First, they are generally much more user-friendly than state-run lotteries. They also offer better odds, as well as a wider variety of bets. And finally, they are available to anyone who wants to use them, regardless of where they live.

The big downside to offshore sportsbooks is that they are not regulated by US law. This means that there is no guarantee that you will get your money back if something goes wrong. It also means that there is no guarantee that the games are being played fairly.

So how will the new college sports betting laws affect fans? It's hard to say at this point. Some states may choose to legalize sports betting within their borders, while others may not. It's also unclear how the NCAA and other governing bodies will react to legalized gambling. Will they prohibit athletes from betting on their own games? Will they limit how much money schools can earn from gambling? Only time will tell.

#  How Does This Change the Future of College Sports?

On October 14, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an appeal from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to keep in place a ban on states’ ability to offer college athletes in commercial sports betting markets. This means that each state is now able to legalize and regulate sports betting as they see fit. The NCAA has claimed that gambling could lead to corruption in college sports, but this ruling seems to suggest that this is not a strong enough argument to keep the ban in place. So, what does this mean for the future of college sports?

First and foremost, this ruling opens up new revenue streams for universities and colleges that choose to allow gambling on their sporting events. There are currently billions of dollars wagered on college sports every year, so there is clearly a demand for it. This money could be used to support athletic programs and improve the quality of education that students receive.

Additionally, this ruling could lead to more competitive games as gambling will add another layer of excitement for fans. In fact, many experts believe that this ruling will legitimize college sports and make them more popular than ever before. It is also possible that we will see new forms of gambling emerge specifically related to college sports. For example, bettors might be able to bet on which team will win or lose a specific game, or how many points will be scored by each team.

There are certainly some risks associated with legalizing gambling on college sports, but it appears that the benefits outweigh the risks in this case. Universities and colleges should start planning now for how they will capitalize on this opportunity."

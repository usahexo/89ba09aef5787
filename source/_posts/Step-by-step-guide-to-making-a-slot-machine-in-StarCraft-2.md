#  Step-by-step guide to making a slot machine in StarCraft 2

In this article, we’re going to teach you how to make a slot machine in StarCraft 2. This will be a fairly simple process, but it will require some basic knowledge of the game and its editor.

First, we’re going to create the assets for our slot machine. This includes the images that will be displayed on the machine, as well as the sound effects that will be played when the buttons are pressed. We can create these assets using any image editor or audio editor that we prefer.

For our images, we’re going to need three different files. The first file will be a picture of a coin, which we’ll save as “coin.png”. The second file will be a picture of three coins stacked on top of each other, which we’ll save as “coinstack.png”. The third file will be a picture of a corrupted coin, which we’ll save as “corruptedcoin.png”.

For our sound effects, we’re going to need two different files. The first file will be a sound effect for the button presses, which we’ll save as “buttonpress1.wav”. The second file will be a sound effect for when the player wins, which we’ll save as “win1.wav”.

Now that we have our assets created, we can start creating our slot machine in StarCraft 2. We’re going to do this by creating three new maps: one for the coin slot machine itself, one for the coin stack slot machine, and one for the corrupted coin slot machine.

We can create these maps by opening the StarCraft 2 editor and selecting File > New > Map. For each map, we need to set its dimensions to 128x128 pixels and its terrain type to “none” (this can be done by selecting Edit > Properties from the main menu). We also need to name each map appropriately: “coinSlotMachine1.sc2map”, “coinStackSlotMachine1.sc2map”, and “corruptedCoinSlotMachine1 .sc2map” respectively.

Now that our maps have been created, we can start adding objects to them. For our coin slot machine, we need to add six objects: one for each of the following: an image of a coin (we can find this object by searching for “coin_01″), a text object (we can find this object by searching for “text_01″), an obstacle (we can find this object by searching for ‘rock_ground_medium"), and three unit groups (we can find these objects by searching for "unit_group_marine"). We need to place these objects in the following positions:























#  How to make a tiny slot machine that still works in StarCraft 2

In this article, we're going to show you how to make a tiny slot machine in StarCraft 2 that still works. This slot machine is perfect for people who want a smaller and more compact alternative to the standard slot machines available in the game.

The first thing you'll need to do is gather the following materials:

- Three Microswitches
- One Small Wooden Crate
- Six Wooden Planks
- One Poker Chip

Once you have all of the materials, you'll need to follow these steps to create the slot machine:

1. Cut two planks of wood into two long strips measuring 6 cm by 1 cm. Then use sandpaper or a file to smooth out any rough edges. These will be the sides of the slot machine.
2. Drill a hole in each end of each plank and then insert a microswitch into each hole so that it is flush with the surface of the plank. Make sure that the microswitches are in the ON position (see image below). 
3. Glue or screw three planks of wood onto one side of each strip so that they form a small crate (see image below). 
4. Glue or screw one plank onto the other side of each strip so that it forms a top and bottom for the crate (see image below). 
5. Glue or screw a poker chip onto the top plank so that it can act as the lever for activating the microswitches (see image below). 
6. Test your slot machine by pressing down on the poker chip to activate the microswitches. If everything is working correctly, you should see all three microswitches turn ON (see image below).

#  StarCraft 2 guide shows you how to make a slot machine that fits in any space

StarCraft 2 guide can let you know how to make a slot machine. The first step is to get the right supplies. You need a few thin boards, screws, nails, a hammer, some dowels or sticks, glue and a battery operated drill.

The next step is to construct the body of the machine. Begin by nailing two thin boards together in the shape of an L. Glue a dowel or stick to the top front edge of this board and then do the same to the back. This will be your machine's frame.

Now it's time to create the sides of the machine. Cut two thin boards in half and then nail them each to a side of the frame so that they form a 90 degree angle. Then screw them in place from the inside using short screws. These will act as guides for your spinning wheels.

It's now time to add the wheels. Cut two circles out of thin board using a compass or other circle cutting tool. Mark their center points and then drill a hole through the middle of each using your battery powered drill (make sure it's not too large lest your coins escape). Now use long screws to attach each wheel to its corresponding side piece, making sure they turn easily. If they don't, sand down their edges until they do.

The final step is to create the coin trough. Cut a thin board in half and then nail it to the bottom front edge of the machine (opposite from where you attached the dowel/stick earlier). This will hold your coins while they're being played on the machine. Finally, use some more screws (or nails) to fasten down your completed machine so it doesn't move around while in use!

#  New StarCraft 2 tutorial shows you how to make a miniature slot machine

In this tutorial, we're going to show you how to make a miniature slot machine out of StarCraft 2 components. It's a really fun project that doesn't require too many materials or skills, and the end result is really impressive!

To start off, you're going to need the following items:

* 3 x SCVs
* 1 x Refinery
* 1 x Bunker
* 1 x Supply Depot
* 1 x Academy
* 1 x Engineering bay
* 1 x Stargate
* 1 x Robotics Facility
* 1 x Citadel of Adun
* 1 x Fleet Beacon
* 1 x Arbiter Tribunal
* Silver and red paint (optional) 

Once you have all of the required materials, follow these steps to create your miniature slot machine:

1. First, you'll want to create the base for your machine. The best way to do this is by using the SCV model. Create a circle out of toothpicks or other thin objects, and then glue the SCVs around it in a circular pattern. Make sure that they're all facing inwards so that the base looks like a well. If you want, you can also paint the base silver and red to give it a more finished look. 

2. Next, you'll need to create the lever for your machine. Cut a small piece of cardboard or paper into a triangular shape, and then glue it onto the front of one of the SCVs. You can also paint this part silver or red if you want it to match the rest of the machine. 

3. Now it's time to create the reels for your slot machine. Cut three small pieces of cardboard or paper into square shapes, and then glue them onto the front of three different SCVs. You can also paint these pieces any color you want – we recommend using silver or black as they'll be more visible against the red and silver background of the base. 

4. Finally, it's time to add some finishing touches to your machine! Glue on an extra SCV model at either side of the top front corner of your machine (next to where the lever is), and then add some decals or stickers if desired. You're now ready to play with your very own mini slot machine!

#  StarCraft 2 makes it easy to create a functional slot machine in minimum space

## StarCraft 2

StarCraft II is a real-time strategy game released in 2010. The game uses two armies of sci-fi units, Terran, Zerg and Protoss to compete in a singleplayer or multiplayer battle.

The players must gather resources, build structures and units to defeat their opponent. The game has three playable races and provides a balanced experience by giving each race unique abilities and strategies.

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a basic slot machine using the Protoss race in StarCraft II.

# Requirements

To follow this tutorial you will need the following:

* A copy of StarCraft II Wings of Liberty (or any other expansion)
 * An understanding of the StarCraft II map editor * Some basic programming knowledge * Some experience with 3D modelling software (optional)
  # Step 1 - Creating the Blueprint for our Slot Machine
First we need to create a blueprint for our slot machine. This will contain all the information we need about the size, shape and layout of our unit. We can do this using the 3D modelling software of our choice or by drawing it out in a vector graphics program such as Adobe Illustrator. I have created a simple blueprint for our slot machine in Adobe Illustrator (see below).































      # Step 2 - Importing our Blueprint into StarCraft II Map Editor
Now that we have created our blueprint for our slot machine we need to import it into the StarCraft II map editor. To do this we first need to create a new map file. You can do this by clicking on File > New from the menu bar in the StarCraft II map editor. Next we need to selectImport from the File menu and then select Image from the sub-menu. Navigate to where you saved your blueprint file and select it. The image will now be imported into your map file (see below). Note that your blueprint will be imported at 100%. This means that if your blueprint is 10x10 pixels then your slot machine will be 10x10 cells in size when imported into the map editor. You can scale it down if you wish but I recommend keeping it at 100% so that you have more flexibility when designing your slot machine later on. For this tutorial I am going to keep my blueprint at 100%. If you want to try scaling your blueprint down then simply enter a percentage value into the Scale field under Properties (see below). I recommend scaling down at least 50% so that your slot machine takes up less space in-game. Once you have finished scaling down your blueprint press OK . Your slot machine should now look something like this:

     # Step 3 - Designing our Slot Machine Now that we have created a blueprint for our slot machine and imported it into the map editor we can start designing it! We can do this by selecting individual cells in-game and changing their properties such as color, shape, etc. We can also add ramps, triggers and other features by using the tools available in the toolbar (see below).

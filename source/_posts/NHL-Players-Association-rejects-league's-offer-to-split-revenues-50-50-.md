#  NHL Players Association rejects league's offer to split revenues 50-50 

The NHL Players Association has unanimously rejected the NHL's latest offer to split revenues 50-50. The proposal, which was made on Tuesday, would have seen players' share of hockey-related revenue reduced from 57 percent to 50 percent.

"It was a pretty clear indication that they're not interested in 50-50," deputy commissioner Bill Daly said after the offer was presented to the NHLPA. "We gave our best shot."

Players were expected to vote on the offer on Wednesday, but the vote was called off after the PA rejected the offer.

NHLPA executive director Don Fehr released a statement shortly after the offer was rejected.

"The players appreciate the League's effort to try and get a deal done," Fehr said. "But at this point, we remain far apart and we have given our best proposal to date."

The NHL lockout is now in its third month, and there is no end in sight.

#  NHLPA files antitrust lawsuit against NHL, claiming owners are colluding to split revenues unequally 

The NHLPA filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NHL on Tuesday, September 25th. The union is accusing the league's owners of colluding to split revenues unequally and implementing a salary cap that restricts player movement.

"The NHLPA has taken this step to preserve the rights and interests of all players," said union executive director Donald Fehr in a statement. "We believe that this proposed salary cap violates the antitrust laws and we are prepared to take any necessary steps to protect our players."

NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly released a statement denying the allegations. "We believe that the union's claims are without merit," said Daly. "We look forward to defending ourselves vigorously in court."

The collusion allegations stem from several signings this offseason that saw players switch teams for less money than they could have received under previous contracts. Kirk Muller, who signed a three-year, $4.5 million contract with Montreal after being courted by three other teams, is the most high-profile example.

"It just seems like everybody is kind of on the same wavelength," said Muller. "It just doesn't seem right."

Players aren't happy about the situation, but they're also hesitant to speak out for fear of retribution from team management. Said Winnipeg Jets captain Andrew Ladd: "You don't want to rock the boat when things are going well."

#  Players and owners reach tentative agreement to split revenues 50-50 

The NFL Players Association announced that they have reached a tentative agreement with the NFL owners to split league revenues 50-50. The move comes as a relief to both groups, who have been embroiled in negotiations for months.

"We're happy to be able to come to an agreement that's fair for both sides," said NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith. "It's time to get back to football."

Under the previous CBA, which expired in March, players received around 47% of league revenues. The new agreement would see that number jump to 50%.

Owners had been seeking a greater share of revenue, while the players were looking to maintain the status quo. The two sides were reportedly close to an agreement earlier this year, but talks stalled over the issue of guaranteed contracts.

The new CBA still needs to be ratified by both the players and the owners, but that is expected to happen without any problems. Training camps are scheduled to open later this month.

#  NHLPA approves league's offer to split revenues 50-50, ending lockout 

After 113 days, the NHL and NHLPA have come to an agreement that will see the players receive a 50-50 split of league revenues. The vote was overwhelmingly in favor, with ratification by the players expected to be a formality.

"This is a great day for hockey," said NHLPA Executive Director Don Fehr. "It's good for the players, the owners, and most importantly, the fans."

The decision ends a lockout that saw the entire preseason and first two months of the regular season cancelled. It also means that teams will finally be able to start making moves in advance of the January 19 trade deadline.

"We're very pleased that the parties have arrived at a resolution that will bring the lockout to a close," said NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. "We want to thank our fans for their patience and loyalty. We're excited to get back on the ice and bring them the best hockey possible."

#  NHLPA and NHL announce new agreement to split revenue 50-50
On September 12, the NHLPA and NHL announced that they had come to an agreement on a new revenue sharing plan. The new agreement will see the revenue split 50-50, significantly more equitable than the previous 37-63 split.

NHLPA executive director Donald Fehr was happy with the new deal. "We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the NHL that is fair for both players and teams," he said in a statement. "We believe that this deal is good for players and good for teams, and provides a foundation for our sport to grow and prosper for years to come."

The NHL also released a statement, saying that they were "pleased to have reached an agreement with the NHLPA that will allow us to move forward with collective bargaining negotiations in a constructive manner."

The new agreement comes after several months of tense negotiations between the two sides. The lockout, which began in September of 2012, cost the league and its players around $1 billion in lost revenue.
